A thought has been bothering me lately during meetings.
Not about the agenda.
Not about the discussion quality.
Something feels different.
My agent isn’t here.
If my agent is the one who will eventually implement, analyze, draft, simulate, and execute most of the follow-up work, why are we making decisions without it in the room?
And if the agent isn’t present, are we actually wasting part of the meeting?
For years, meetings assumed a very specific workflow. Humans discuss. Humans decide. Humans go back and execute. The people in the room were the ones who would do the work later, so alignment made sense. The decision-makers and the executors were the same group.
Today, a large portion of execution is delegated to agents. They write the code, analyze the logs, generate the docs, explore design options, and draft the first implementation. In many cases, they are faster and more thorough than we are. Which means something subtle has changed. The “doers” are no longer fully represented in the meeting.
So what happens?
We make decisions based on partial information. We debate feasibility without quickly validating it. We speculate about tradeoffs that an agent could prototype in minutes. We leave with action items that could have been pre-computed during the conversation. In short, we talk first and test later.
But in an agentic workflow, that order is backwards. If agents compress execution to minutes or hours, then meetings should compress uncertainty, not create more of it. Instead of debating what might work, we should be asking the agent in real time. Instead of guessing complexity, we should generate a quick implementation. Instead of assigning follow-up analysis, we should produce it on the spot. The meeting becomes less about opinions and more about evidence.
This doesn’t mean replacing humans. It means changing the role of humans. We should focus on framing the problem, defining constraints, and making judgment calls, while the agent handles exploration and validation live.
In that world, an agent is not a tool you use after the meeting. It is a participant during the meeting. Almost like a quiet engineer sitting next to you, ready to answer “what if” instantly.
So now I catch myself thinking in meetings: if my agent isn’t here, are we making decisions blind?
Because increasingly, the highest leverage thing in the room isn’t another opinion. It’s faster feedback.
