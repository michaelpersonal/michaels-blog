### About This Blog

This blog is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, and deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

Feel free to explore and check out my [portfolio](https://michael-terminal.vercel.app) for more about me.

## Code Example

Here's a simple code block to test syntax highlighting:

```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("World"))
```

Thanks for reading!
